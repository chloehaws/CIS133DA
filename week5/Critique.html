    <H1>3 design practices that have been implemented well</H1>
    <p>The website had and easy navigation throughout that appeals to the tarhet audience. Next, all of the websites navigation link work so customers are able to get from page to page. Lastly, the color schemes of blue and gree are consistently used throught the entire website.</p>

    <H2>3 design practices that could have been implemented in a better way</H2>
    <p>Firstly the website does not use the correct fonts listed and has inconsitent fonts thourhgt the webiste. Second, Some of the visials do not match as they switch from brech to forest. And last;y, the websites graphics dont paticularly match what is on the navigation or what the page is talking about. The pictures of the forest does not match the description of going kayacking. </p>

    <H3>How I would further improve the website.</H3>
    <p>I personally to help this webiste would disp;lay better images that more go with the information and beach theme. As the navigation pages swtch fomr beach to forest images which does not match. I would also add some more colors that jump out instead of suble ones spo the webiste it more appealing to the eyes. </p>
